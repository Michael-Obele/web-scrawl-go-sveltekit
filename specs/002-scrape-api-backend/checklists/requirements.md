# Specification Quality Checklist: Build /scrape API: Go backend endpoint

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - PASS: The spec avoids implementation detail in requirements and success criteria; however the original user description explicitly mentioned Colly, Chromedp and GoQuery which are referenced in the feature title/input. These are noted in Input and FR-002 references to Colly/Chromedp/GoQuery exist in the Requirements which is an implementation detail. Recommend removing specific library names from the Requirements if the spec must be strictly implementation-agnostic. For planning purposes we accept FR-002 as intentionally prescriptive for this repo.
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - PASS: User stories and why sections clearly state value (preview, QA, structured results).
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - PASS: Language is non-technical in most areas; some technical terms appear in Input and Requirements for clarity to implementers.
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - PASS: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Key Entities are present.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - PASS: No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers found.
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - PASS: Requirements map to testable outcomes (endpoint, JSON shape, controls). Note: FR-002 names libraries which narrows implementation choices; still testable.
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - PASS: SC entries contain measurable targets (time, percentage, smoke-test pass).
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - PARTIAL: Success criteria are user-focused and technology-agnostic; however the spec overall references specific libraries in Input/FRs which is acceptable as implementation guidance but should be removed if strict separation is required.
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - PASS: Acceptance scenarios provided for primary user stories.
- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - PASS: Edge cases section lists unreachable hosts, large DOMs, robots.txt handling, Chromedp fallback.
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - PASS: Out of Scope section explicitly excludes large-scale crawling and storage.
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - PASS: Assumptions section lists Chromedp availability, monorepo layout, and intended low-volume usage.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - PASS: FR items map to acceptance scenarios and tests (FR-001/FR-003/FR-008 linked).
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - PASS: Primary flows (single scrape, UI flow, ethical controls) included.
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - PASS: Criteria are realistic and tied to tests; smoke test specified.
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - PARTIAL: The spec includes implementation-specific library names (Colly, Chromedp, GoQuery) in FR-002 and Input; if spec must be platform-agnostic remove these. Otherwise acceptable.

## Notes

- The spec is ready for planning with minor cleanup if strict separation of implementation details is required. The presence of explicit library names was requested by the user and is documented in the Input; keep or remove based on team policy.
