# Data Model: Scrape API

## Entities

- ScrapeResult

  - title: string, required, non-empty
  - markdown: string, required (converted main content), may be large
  - links: array of Link objects, required (may be empty)
  - warnings: array of string, optional
  - fetchedAt: string (ISO-8601 timestamp), required

- Link
  - href: string (absolute URL), required
  - text: string, optional (link text or anchor)

## Validation Rules

- title must be trimmed and non-empty for successful scrapes; otherwise include warning and still return partial result when possible
- markdown must be a UTF-8 string; if conversion fails provide a fallback plain text and a warning
- href values must be absolute URLs; normalize relative URLs against the origin
- fetchedAt must be generated by the server at time of finalization

## Notes

- No persistent storage for MVP; the ScrapeResult is returned in response payload only
