# Tasks: Monorepo Initialization

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-monorepo-init/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL - only included if explicitly requested. This feature uses lightweight verification per constitutional principle III (bun check + go test smoke tests).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app**: `backend/` and `frontend/` at repository root
- Paths shown below follow the monorepo structure from plan.md

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and prerequisite checks

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T005 Create `backend/` directory at repository root
- [X] T006 Create `frontend/` directory at repository root
- [X] T007 Create `.gitignore` with entries for `node_modules/`, `bun.lockb`, `go.sum`, `.DS_Store`, `dist/`, `.svelte-kit/`

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently. Both directories exist with all dependencies installed.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Development Environment Setup (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable developers to start frontend (SvelteKit on :5173) and backend (Gin on :8080) services independently with hot-reloading and proper logging.

**Independent Test**: Run `bun dev` from frontend/ directory - verify dev server starts on port 5173 with HMR enabled. Run `go run main.go` from backend/ directory - verify Gin server starts on :8080 with startup logs. Confirm both services can run simultaneously without port conflicts. Make a change to a frontend file and verify browser auto-reloads.

### Backend Server Implementation

- [X] T030 [P] [US2] Create backend/main.go with package main, import statements for Gin and CORS
- [X] T031 [US2] Implement main() function in backend/main.go: initialize Gin router with `gin.Default()`
- [X] T032 [US2] Add CORS middleware config in backend/main.go: allow origin `http://localhost:5173`, methods GET/POST/PUT/DELETE, headers Content-Type/Authorization
- [X] T033 [US2] Apply CORS middleware to router using `router.Use(cors.New(config))` in backend/main.go
- [X] T034 [US2] Add startup logging in backend/main.go: `log.Println("Starting server on :8080")`
- [X] T035 [US2] Add server start command in backend/main.go: `router.Run(":8080")` with error handling
- [X] T036 [US2] Test backend startup: run `go run main.go` from backend/ and verify server starts without errors

### Frontend Development Server

- [X] T037 [P] [US2] Verify frontend/vite.config.ts exists and configures SvelteKit plugin
- [X] T038 [US2] Test frontend startup: run `bun dev` from frontend/ and verify dev server starts on port 5173
- [X] T039 [US2] Verify hot module replacement: make a change to frontend/src/routes/+page.svelte and confirm browser auto-reloads
- [X] T040 [US2] Update frontend/src/routes/+page.svelte with minimal content: heading "Web Scraper", paragraph with project description

### Concurrent Execution Validation

- [X] T041 [US2] Test concurrent execution: start backend with `go run main.go` in one terminal, start frontend with `bun dev` in another terminal
- [X] T042 [US2] Verify both services accessible: `http://localhost:5173` (frontend) and `http://localhost:8080` (backend logs confirm running)
- [X] T043 [US2] Document run commands in README.md: separate sections for starting frontend and backend

**Checkpoint**: Both services now start successfully and can run concurrently. Development workflow enabled.

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Health Check Endpoint & Proxy (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Implement `/health` endpoint in Go backend, create SvelteKit server route proxy, and build UI page to display health status - validating complete frontend-to-backend communication pattern.

**Independent Test**: Start both services. Access `http://localhost:8080/health` directly - verify returns JSON `{status: "healthy", service: "web-scraper-backend", timestamp: <number>}`. Access `http://localhost:5173/health` through frontend - verify page displays health status from backend without CORS errors. Stop backend, refresh frontend health page - verify error handling shows appropriate message.

### Backend Health Endpoint

- [X] T044 [P] [US3] Create backend/handlers/health.go with package handlers
- [X] T045 [US3] Implement HealthCheck handler in backend/handlers/health.go: return JSON with status="healthy", service="web-scraper-backend", timestamp=Unix time
- [X] T046 [US3] Register health route in backend/main.go: `router.GET("/health", handlers.HealthCheck)` before server start
- [X] T047 [US3] Test health endpoint directly: run `curl http://localhost:8080/health` and verify JSON response with correct fields

### Backend Health Test (Smoke Test)

- [X] T048 [P] [US3] Create backend/tests/health_test.go with package tests
- [X] T049 [US3] Implement TestHealthCheck in backend/tests/health_test.go: use httptest to call /health handler, assert status 200, assert response body contains status="healthy"
- [X] T050 [US3] Run backend tests: `go test ./... -v` from backend/ directory and verify TestHealthCheck passes

### Frontend Health Proxy & UI

- [X] T051 [P] [US3] Create frontend/src/routes/health/ directory
- [X] T052 [US3] Create frontend/src/routes/health/+page.server.js with load function that fetches from `http://localhost:8080/health`
- [X] T053 [US3] Add error handling in +page.server.js load function: catch fetch failures, return `{health: null, error: "Backend service is not available"}`
- [X] T054 [P] [US3] Create frontend/src/routes/health/+page.svelte with script importing Check and X icons from lucide-svelte
- [X] T055 [US3] Add props destructuring in +page.svelte: `let { data } = $props();`
- [X] T056 [US3] Implement success UI in +page.svelte: green alert with Check icon showing backend health data (status, service, timestamp)
- [X] T057 [US3] Implement error UI in +page.svelte: red alert with X icon showing error message when backend unavailable
- [X] T058 [US3] Update frontend/src/routes/+page.svelte to import Button from '$lib/components/ui/button' and add link to /health route

### End-to-End Integration Testing

- [X] T059 [US3] Test health proxy with backend running: access `http://localhost:5173/health` and verify green success message displays
- [X] T060 [US3] Test error handling: stop backend, refresh frontend /health page, verify red error message displays
- [X] T061 [US3] Verify no CORS errors: check browser console while accessing /health route - should show no CORS-related errors
- [X] T062 [US3] Test timestamp display: verify health page shows formatted timestamp (convert Unix epoch to readable date)

**Checkpoint**: Complete frontend-to-backend communication validated. Health check proves architectural pattern for all future API calls.

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Documentation, final validation, and project cleanup

- [X] T063 [P] Create backend/README.md with: Go version requirement, dependency installation, run commands, test commands
- [X] T064 [P] Create frontend/README.md with: Bun version requirement, dependency installation, run commands, available scripts
- [X] T065 Update root README.md with: project overview, monorepo structure explanation, quick start guide referencing specs/001-monorepo-init/quickstart.md
- [X] T066 Run final validation: `bun check` in frontend/ (TypeScript validation)
- [X] T067 Run final validation: `go test ./... -v` in backend/ (smoke tests)
- [X] T068 Verify .gitignore excludes: node_modules/, bun.lockb, .svelte-kit/, dist/, go.sum (check with `git status`)
- [X] T069 Create backend/.env.example with PORT=8080 and ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173
- [X] T070 Create frontend/.env.example with PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
- [ ] T071 Test complete workflow from scratch: follow quickstart.md steps and verify all commands execute successfully
- [ ] T072 Commit all changes: `git add . && git commit -m "feat: initialize monorepo with SvelteKit and Go"`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### User Story Completion Order

1. **User Story 1 (P1)**: MUST complete first - establishes directory structure and dependencies
2. **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after US1 complete - enables development workflow
3. **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after US2 complete - validates integration pattern

**Dependency Graph**:

```
Setup (T001-T004)
  ‚Üì
Foundational (T005-T007)
  ‚Üì
US1: Structure (T008-T029) ‚Üê Foundation for everything
  ‚Üì
US2: Dev Environment (T030-T043) ‚Üê Needs US1 files
  ‚Üì
US3: Health & Proxy (T044-T062) ‚Üê Needs US2 servers running
  ‚Üì
Polish (T063-T072)
```

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
