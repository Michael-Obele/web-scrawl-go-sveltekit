# Specification Quality Checklist: Monorepo Initialization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **PASS** - Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY without implementation details. While the user input mentions specific technologies (SvelteKit, Go, Tailwind, etc.), the specification treats these as project requirements rather than implementation choices. The spec is written for stakeholders to understand the monorepo structure, development workflow, and integration patterns.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - All 14 functional requirements are clearly stated, testable, and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. All assumptions documented in dedicated section.

### Success Criteria Assessment

✅ **PASS** - All 7 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics:

- Time-based: "under 5 minutes", "within 10 seconds", "within 100 milliseconds", "within 2 seconds"
- Count-based: "Zero CORS errors"
- Boolean verification: "correctly installed and importable without errors"

Success criteria are technology-agnostic in presentation (e.g., "services start successfully" rather than "Gin server initializes"), though they reference the required tech stack established in project constitution.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - Feature is ready for planning phase:

- 3 user stories with clear priorities (P1-P3) covering foundation → development → integration
- Each story is independently testable and delivers standalone value
- 14 functional requirements map to user stories and acceptance scenarios
- 5 edge cases identified for robust implementation
- 10 assumptions documented to clarify scope

## Notes

**Specification Quality**: ✅ Complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`

**Context Note**: This is a foundational infrastructure feature where the "users" are developers setting up the project. The specification correctly treats the monorepo initialization as a user journey focused on enabling rapid development workflow.

**No blocking issues found** - Specification meets all quality criteria and is ready for planning phase.
