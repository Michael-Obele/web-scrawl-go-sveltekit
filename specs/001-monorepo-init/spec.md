# Feature Specification: Monorepo Initialization

**Feature Branch**: `001-monorepo-init`  
**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Initialize monorepo: Create frontend/ (SvelteKit with Bun, Tailwind, Lucide Svelte, shadcn-svelte setup) and backend/ (Golang Gin server with Colly/Chromedp/GoQuery deps). Add package.json/bun.lockb/go.mod, basic run scripts (bun dev for frontend, go run for backend), and CORS middleware in Go. Include a simple health check endpoint (/health) in Go, proxied via SvelteKit +page.server.js."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Project Structure Creation (Priority: P1)

A developer initializes the web scraper project by setting up the monorepo structure with frontend and backend directories, enabling separate development workflows for each service while maintaining a unified codebase.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation for all future development. Without the proper directory structure and configuration files, no other features can be built. It establishes the architectural boundary between frontend and backend services.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying the existence of `frontend/` and `backend/` directories with their respective configuration files (`package.json`, `go.mod`) and confirming each directory is self-contained with no cross-dependencies.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an empty repository, **When** the monorepo is initialized, **Then** `frontend/` and `backend/` directories are created at the root level
2. **Given** the monorepo structure is created, **When** inspecting the `frontend/` directory, **Then** it contains `package.json`, `bun.lockb`, and SvelteKit project structure
3. **Given** the monorepo structure is created, **When** inspecting the `backend/` directory, **Then** it contains `go.mod`, `go.sum`, and Gin server structure
4. **Given** both directories exist, **When** examining dependencies, **Then** frontend includes Bun, SvelteKit, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Svelte, and shadcn-svelte
5. **Given** both directories exist, **When** examining backend dependencies, **Then** Go modules include Gin, Colly, Chromedp, and GoQuery

### User Story 2 - Development Environment Setup (Priority: P2)

A developer starts the development servers for both frontend and backend services independently, enabling rapid iteration during feature development with hot-reloading and proper environment separation.

**Why this priority**: After structure is created, developers need to run the services locally. This enables the development workflow and validates that all dependencies are correctly configured.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running `bun dev` in the `frontend/` directory (verifies SvelteKit server starts on port 5173) and `go run main.go` in the `backend/` directory (verifies Gin server starts on port 8080), confirming both services can run simultaneously without conflicts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the frontend directory is set up, **When** developer runs `bun dev` from `frontend/`, **Then** SvelteKit development server starts on port 5173 with hot-reload enabled
2. **Given** the backend directory is set up, **When** developer runs `go run main.go` from `backend/`, **Then** Gin server starts on port 8080 and logs startup confirmation
3. **Given** both services are configured, **When** developer runs both commands in separate terminals, **Then** both services run simultaneously without port conflicts or errors
4. **Given** the development environment is running, **When** developer makes a change to a frontend file, **Then** the browser automatically reloads with the updated content
5. **Given** the development environment is running, **When** developer makes a change to a backend file and restarts the Go server, **Then** the updated API logic is immediately available

---

### User Story 3 - Health Check Endpoint & Proxy (Priority: P3)

A developer verifies backend connectivity by accessing a health check endpoint through the SvelteKit server-side proxy, confirming that the frontend can successfully communicate with the backend API and that CORS is properly configured.

**Why this priority**: This validates the integration between frontend and backend services. It proves the architectural pattern (SvelteKit server routes proxying to Go backend) works correctly, which is critical for all future API communication.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing `/health` through the SvelteKit application (port 5173) and verifying it returns a successful response from the Go backend, demonstrating the complete request flow: browser → SvelteKit → Go backend → response.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the Go backend is running, **When** a request is made directly to `http://localhost:8080/health`, **Then** it returns a 200 status with a JSON response indicating service health
2. **Given** SvelteKit server routes are configured, **When** a request is made to the SvelteKit app at `/health`, **Then** the request is proxied to the Go backend via `+page.server.js`
3. **Given** the proxy is configured, **When** the backend responds, **Then** the SvelteKit server forwards the response to the client without CORS errors
4. **Given** CORS middleware is configured in Go, **When** the SvelteKit server makes a request to the Go backend, **Then** the request includes appropriate headers and the backend allows the origin
5. **Given** both services are running, **When** a developer accesses the SvelteKit app in a browser and navigates to the health check route, **Then** the page displays the health status from the backend API

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the backend service is not running but the frontend attempts to proxy a request (health check)?
- How does the system handle version mismatches between Bun/SvelteKit or Go module versions?
- What happens if port 5173 or 8080 is already in use by another service?
- How does the system handle missing environment variables or configuration files?
- What happens if shadcn-svelte components are installed before Tailwind CSS is configured?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST create a monorepo structure with separate `frontend/` and `backend/` directories at the repository root
- **FR-002**: Frontend directory MUST include a SvelteKit project initialized with Bun as the package manager
- **FR-003**: Frontend MUST include Tailwind CSS, Lucide Svelte, and shadcn-svelte as dependencies in `package.json`
- **FR-004**: Backend directory MUST include a Go project with `go.mod` file specifying Gin, Colly, Chromedp, and GoQuery as dependencies
- **FR-005**: Frontend MUST provide a run script (`bun dev`) that starts the SvelteKit development server on port 5173
- **FR-006**: Backend MUST provide a run command (`go run main.go`) that starts the Gin server on port 8080
- **FR-007**: Backend MUST implement CORS middleware that allows requests from the SvelteKit development server
- **FR-008**: Backend MUST expose a `/health` endpoint that returns the service status as JSON
- **FR-009**: Frontend MUST include a SvelteKit server route (`+page.server.js`) that proxies requests to the backend `/health` endpoint
- **FR-010**: Both services MUST be able to run concurrently without configuration conflicts
- **FR-011**: Frontend configuration MUST include TypeScript support with proper type checking
- **FR-012**: Backend MUST log server startup confirmation and listening port to console

- **FR-014**: System MUST generate lock files (`bun.lockb` for frontend, `go.sum` for backend) to ensure reproducible builds

### Key Entities

- **Frontend Service**: The SvelteKit application responsible for UI rendering, user interaction, and server-side proxying to the backend. Contains all client-side code, styling (Tailwind CSS), UI components (shadcn-svelte), and icons (Lucide Svelte).

- **Backend Service**: The Go API server responsible for web scraping operations, data parsing, and API endpoint exposure. Built with Gin framework and includes scraping libraries (Colly, Chromedp, GoQuery).

- **Health Check Endpoint**: A simple API endpoint (`/health`) that returns service status information, used to verify backend connectivity and validate the frontend-to-backend communication pattern.

- **Proxy Route**: A SvelteKit server route (`+page.server.js`) that acts as an intermediary between the client and the Go backend, handling CORS and enabling seamless API communication without direct client-to-Go requests.

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers can create the complete monorepo structure by running initialization commands in under 5 minutes
- **SC-002**: Both frontend and backend services start successfully on their designated ports (5173 and 8080) within 10 seconds of running their respective commands
- **SC-003**: Health check endpoint responds with valid JSON within 100 milliseconds when accessed through the SvelteKit proxy
- **SC-004**: Frontend hot-reload reflects code changes in the browser within 2 seconds of saving a file
- **SC-005**: Zero CORS errors occur when the frontend proxies requests to the backend during development
- **SC-006**: All specified dependencies (SvelteKit, Tailwind, Lucide Svelte, shadcn-svelte, Gin, Colly, Chromedp, GoQuery) are correctly installed and importable without errors
- **SC-007**: Developers can run both services simultaneously in separate terminal sessions without manual configuration or port conflict resolution
